# Committed Cache Directory

This directory contains cache files that are intentionally committed to source control for testing purposes.

## Purpose

This directory is used by the `committed_cache_spec.rb` test suite to verify that:
1. Cache files can be stored in a non-git-ignored directory
2. Once populated, no new files are created on subsequent runs
3. The cache remains stable across different environments and PRs

## Files

The cache files in this directory are generated by the test suite and should not be manually modified.
They represent a stable set of cache entries used for validation testing.

## Do Not Ignore

**Important:** This directory and its contents should NOT be added to `.gitignore`. 
The cache files are intentionally version-controlled to ensure test stability.
